# YouTube Clone

Welcome to my YouTube Clone project! This project is a demonstration of my web development skills, showcasing various techniques and technologies used in modern web design.

# Project Overview

**Description**: This YouTube Clone is a web-based replica of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. It mimics the core functionalities and aesthetics of YouTube's user interface, making it an excellent project for learning and demonstrating HTML and CSS techniques.

# Key Features

**Nested Layouts**: The project utilizes nested layouts to structure the web page, allowing for a clear separation of components and a responsive design.

**CSS display, grid, flexbox and position Properties**: I used CSS display properties like grid, flexbox, and position to create a visually appealing and functional layout.

**Responsive Design**: The YouTube Clone is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
